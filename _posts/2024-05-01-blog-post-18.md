Bonjour, everyone! Time feels like itâ€™s slipping away faster than ever these days. With paternity leave in full swing, finding work hours here and there has been a challenge (and honestly, itâ€™s hard not to get distracted by Baby Finnâ€™s cuteness). Despite the chaos, Iâ€™ve managed to make a major leap forward in the project: transitioning from Detectron2 Mask R-CNN to YOLOv8. Let me tell youâ€”itâ€™s been a game-changer.

From the start, YOLOv8 results were much crisper and more reliable than what I was achieving with Mask R-CNN. One of the issues I faced with Mask R-CNN was the finicky tuning of anchor sizes, which felt like a never-ending battle. I experimented endlessly, defining anchors in different ways, but the results always plateaued. In contrast, YOLOv8 just worked. The transition itself wasnâ€™t too bad, though I had to tweak the input formats for images and labels since the two frameworks handle masks differently. Once that hurdle was cleared, training a YOLOv8 model on the dataset published in my previous article was a breeze.

### Expanding the Dataset with Fresh Lunar Impact Craters
Focusing on the freshest impact craters on the Moon, I used YOLOv8 to run predictions around these sites and quickly added new labels based on the output. Of course, this meant revisiting my edge-artifact problem from earlier (again!). This time, I found an excellent GitHub repositoryâ€”SAHI (https://github.com/obss/sahi) â€”and with a few tweaks, I implemented a much better method for handling predictions over large images. Problem solved!

With this setup, I could efficiently map boulders around fresh lunar impact craters, review the predictions, clean up false positives, and add any missing boulders. After a few months of refining this process, I now have 1,988,087 boulders mapped across 82 young and fresh lunar impact structures. Let that sink inâ€”nearly 2 million boulders! To put that into perspective, manually mapping this dataset would have taken 5â€“10 years at best. This level of automation is truly a luxury, and itâ€™s exciting to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in planetary science.

While there are other great groups out there, like the team in Freiburg, Germany (credit where itâ€™s dueâ€”theyâ€™re doing fantastic work too), Iâ€™m proud of how far weâ€™ve come. This dataset is groundbreaking in its scale, and Iâ€™ve already re-trained the YOLOv8 model with these new labels to make it even better for future use by others.

### The Next Challenge: Finding Patterns
The difficult part begins now: extracting meaningful patterns from this vast database. Iâ€™m investigating how target properties (like surface composition or crater size) influence boulder ejection patterns. Itâ€™s a challenging task to untangle these relationships, and progress has been slow. Iâ€™m currently drafting the manuscript and working on figures, but juggling parenthood and research has proven more complicated than Iâ€™d anticipated. Efficiency has never been more crucial!

### Wrapping Things Up
The end of the project is loomingâ€”just around the corner, in fact. Thanks to an extension for my paternity leave, Iâ€™ll have until January 2025 to wrap everything up. These final months are going to be hectic, but Iâ€™m determined to finish strong.

Thatâ€™s it for nowâ€”back to the manuscript (or diaper dutyâ€¦ itâ€™s a toss-up). Take care, everyone! Cheerios! ðŸ˜Š
