After an unforgettable first night in our new apartment—sleeping on the ground because IKEA couldn’t deliver our mattress on time, and discovering that the airbed we’d bought from Target had a massive hole (thanks, Target!)—things quickly improved.

I had my first chance to meet my new colleagues at a barbecue event organized by Stanford’s Department of Geosciences. For the next two years, I’ll be part of the Earth and Planetary Surface Processes Lab (EPSP), led by Associate Professor Mathieu Lapotre. It’s an exciting group, including two other postdocs (Lior Rubanenko and Andrew Gunn) and two PhD students (Michael Hasson and Colin Marvin). Everyone was so welcoming, and the barbecue turned out to be the perfect icebreaker.

The EPSP lab focuses on comparative planetology, which means studying processes we observe on Earth—like dunes or river systems—and applying that knowledge to understand similar features on other planetary surfaces. It’s such a cool interdisciplinary field. If you’re curious, you can find a better explanation (and some of their awesome work) on the lab’s website: [EPSP Lab at Stanford](https://epsp.stanford.edu/).

Between finally moving into our apartment and meeting this amazing team, it feels like everything is starting to fall into place. Here’s to the next steps in this adventure! Cheers! 🍔 🌍
