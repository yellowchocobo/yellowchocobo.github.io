Big life updates, everyone! Siri is now at Stanford! Thanks to a fantastic program from the Norwegian Research Council (NRC), postdocs already involved in NRC projects can apply for a research stay abroad for up to a year. The NRC covers the salary, and with a high success rate for these grants, it’s a great way to build international collaborations. After some searching, Siri found a group at Stanford doing work closely related to her research at NMBU in Ås. A few weeks of visa wrangling later, she’s here!

Having her here is a game-changer. Life without your partner by your side is tough—really tough. It’s such a relief to finally be in the same place, especially during our last few months in the US.

And here’s the biggest news: we’re expecting a baby boy in September! 🎉 While we’d love to stay longer, the logistics of giving birth in the US are... well, let’s say “challenging.” It can cost upwards of $50,000 (!), which is a hard no for us. Thankfully, in Norway, pregnancy care and childbirth are free of charge—as they should be. So, we’re adjusting our timeline and planning to head back to Norway in early July to avoid travel restrictions during late pregnancy.

On the professional front, my first article is finally taking shape, thanks to great feedback from Mathieu. Things are moving quickly now, and I’m aiming to submit it before summer. After that, I’m hoping to prepare things out for one more manuscript before Baby Boss arrives. With the clock ticking, I really need to get the ball rolling!

That’s it for now—lots of changes, but all very exciting. Take care, everyone. Talk soon! 😊
