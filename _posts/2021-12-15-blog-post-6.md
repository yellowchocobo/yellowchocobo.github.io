Hey folks! Big news: Iâ€™m officially a licensed drone operator in the U.S. ðŸŽ‰ On December 9th, 2021, I took the FAAâ€™s Unmanned Aircraft General (UAG) exam, and wow, it was no joke. It felt like cramming for an airline pilotâ€™s test! The 100+ pages of dense regulations, airspace classifications, and emergency procedures were quite the mountain to climb. And, after a grueling 150 minutes, I passedâ€”just barely, with the minimum 70%! Talk about a nail-biter.

Let me give you a quick rundown of what I had to learn (or should I say survive):

Airspace classification: Memorizing which airspace you can fly in without causing a national incident.
Weather interpretation: Deciphering aviation weather reports like I was cracking the Enigma code.
Physiological factors: Keeping myself fit and hydrated (coffee addiction not helping!).
I can now say I have a newfound respect for the skiesâ€”and a drone pilot is practically a co-pilot!
Now, for the less exciting part: I had planned to do fieldwork in Death Valleyâ€™s Mars Hill, a prime Mars analog location. Unfortunately, despite my polite emails and promises of eco-friendly, non-invasive drone use, the National Park Authority said no. Apparently, aerial research there must be conducted with planes. Yes, planes! If only I had a Cessna in my back pocket. Iâ€™m now scouting other field sites in the Sierra Nevada, which should still offer excellent boulder fields for my project. Stay tuned for more adventures in drone regulations!

On a brighter note, Iâ€™ve purchased the Phantom 4 RTK drone, an absolute beast for precision mapping. With programmable flight paths and altitude control, itâ€™s perfect for capturing consistent images under varying light conditions. Iâ€™m itching to test it and see those crisp boulder shots.

Thatâ€™s all for now! Fieldwork planning continues, and Iâ€™m ready to take to the skies (responsibly, of course). Until next time, take care and keep reaching for new heights!
