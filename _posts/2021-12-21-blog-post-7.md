Hey folks! While Iâ€™m still waiting for the fieldwork season to kick off next year, I've been keeping busy with some lunar data. My current focus is mapping boulders around young impact craters on the Moonâ€”by "young," I mean geologically speaking, anywhere from a few million to a couple of hundred million years old. Since the Moon lacks an atmosphere and active geology, erosion is quite slow, preserving impact craters for much longer periods than on Earth.

Iâ€™ve chosen the Censorinus impact crater as my first mapping site. Censorinus is a relatively small, 3.8-kilometer-wide crater on the lunar highlands. Its bright ejecta blanket and well-preserved rays make it an ideal candidate for studying ejecta boulder distributions. The crater was even featured in a 2016 study by Krishna and colleagues, who documented over 240,000 boulders around it. Fun fact: Censorinus formed from an oblique impact, meaning the asteroid hit at a low angle, which creates an asymmetric ejecta patternâ€”a perfect case for my researchâ€‹.

Iâ€™m hoping to collaborate with the authors of that study, as it would be great to compare my mapping to theirs. In machine learning, itâ€™s crucial to understand the variability in how different humans label data. This will help me refine my guidelines for annotating boulder outlines, ensuring consistent results across the project.

Speaking of annotation, thereâ€™s a lot to consider. Should I include shadows in the boulder outlines? How do I handle boulders near the resolution limit of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiterâ€™s Narrow-Angle Camera (NAC) images? These high-res images are enormous, often over 70,000x10,000 pixels, and need to be broken down into smaller tiles for processing. Iâ€™ll need to establish best practices not just for myself but also for any students who might assist in the future.

Lastly, Iâ€™m beginning to train my boulder detection algorithm using Detectron2. Itâ€™s a cutting-edge platform for object detection, but adapting it to lunar data is a challenge. With so many rocks on the Moon, the algorithm needs a large and well-labeled dataset to perform accurately. Plenty of work ahead!

Thatâ€™s all for now. Time to wrap up and get ready for a cozy Christmas back home in Norway. Take care, and happy holidays! ðŸŽ„
