Hey folks! Before I jump into fieldwork, I need to get comfortable with my new drone. That means finding a spot for a test flightâ€”easier said than done in the Bay Area! Drones are only allowed in uncontrolled airspace (Class G), and with major airports like SF and Oakland nearby, plus a bunch of smaller ones, Class G airspace is as rare as a unicorn.

I scouted the hills southwest of Stanford, hoping for a quiet field. But between protected wildlife areas and private properties wrapped in barbed wire, my luck ran out. After a few car trips and a lot of Googling, I stumbled upon Baylands Park. Although itâ€™s not technically in Class G and sits suspiciously close to SF airport, it came highly recommended by the drone community. Fingers crossed, I decided to give it a go. And wow, what an experience! After setting up on a big grassy field, I got the drone ready. Drawing a flight path on the controller screen was surprisingly intuitive. Once everything was set, I hit the magic button, and the drone took off, flew its route, and landed all by itself. Super smooth! I just had to keep an eye on the battery, which drains faster than youâ€™d think, and make sure the drone stayed within range.

Next up: processing the images. Drones capture a ton of data, and I used Metashape Pro, a fantastic tool available in Mathieuâ€™s lab, to stitch the images together into an orthoimage. These geo-referenced images can be imported straight into GIS software like QGISâ€”an absolute game-changer for my workflow.

Fieldwork is right around the corner, but before that, Iâ€™ll present my preliminary results at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March. Itâ€™ll be great to get some feedback and fine-tune my process. Until then, peace out and take care! ðŸ˜Š
