Letâ€™s go!!! ðŸŽ‰ After nearly two years of hard work, my first article for the BOULDERING project has been accepted in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets! You can check it out [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JE008013). This has been a long road, but also an incredibly rewarding one. Over 33,000 boulders were collected across more than 750 tiles/images from three planetary bodies: Earth, Mars, and the Moon.

The dataset, including images, labeled boulder data, the model setup for the best-performing Mask R-CNN model, and its trained weights, is now publicly available on Zenodo:

- Dataset: [Zenodo Link](https://zenodo.org/records/8171052)
- Code: [Zenodo Link](https://zenodo.org/records/8367599)
- Updated Repositories: [GitHub](https://github.com/astroNils)

While the model achieved human-like detection ratesâ€”average precision: 72%, recall: 64%â€”Iâ€™m still not completely satisfied with its generalization. Over the next few months, I plan to improve the machine learning code base, and Iâ€™m considering switching to YOLO. Early tests have shown that YOLO delivers superior results using the same dataset, so letâ€™s see where this exploration takes me!

On the personal front, things have been busy with baby Finnâ€™s arrival at the end of August, two weeks earlier than expected! Luckily, we had everything ready to go (phew!). Adjusting to parenthood has been a whirlwind, especially with sleepless nights, but itâ€™s been such a joy.

Norwayâ€™s parental leave system is fantastic, giving us much-needed time to bond with Finn. Iâ€™ll be on paternity leave from April through August, and Iâ€™ve taken some extra holiday leave too. Work has understandably taken a back seat lately as we settle into life as new parents.

The move back to Norway from the US was quite the challenge, especially with Siri being heavily pregnant. We had to sell all our furniture, pack up our lives into countless suitcases (and a few precious framed paintingsâ€”2 out of 3 survived the journey!), and navigate international travel. Despite the chaos, the experience of living in the US was extraordinary. Iâ€™m so grateful to the Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Fellowship program for making it possible.

Iâ€™ll miss the amazing colleagues, the sunny California weather, and the breathtaking nature. But at the same time, it feels good to be back in Europeâ€”because, well, you canâ€™t have it all! Iâ€™m keeping in touch with my Stanford colleagues, especially Mathieu. Fun fact: Brian, one of the undergraduates who worked on the project, is now publishing his own article comparing our boulder detection algorithm with rock abundance data from the DIVINER instrument onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. (Google itâ€”super interesting stuff!)

Gotta runâ€”Finnâ€™s crying, and itâ€™s my turn! Take care, everyone! ðŸ˜Š
