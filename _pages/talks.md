# Outreach activities

During my PhD and postdocs at the University of Oslo and Stanford University, I spent about 1–2 weeks a year conducting outreach activities. Here is an example list of activities:

- Science fair of Oslo, Forskningstorget (two times).
- Live coverage of Insight’s landing at the “Astronomy on Tap” event (Oslo, Norway).
- Contributed to articles about my own research in online newspapers (see forskning.no and uniforum.uio.no)
- Collaborated with a Sandvika (Oslo, Norway) high school on planetary science-related projects.
- Participated as a mentor in the Sustainability Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) Program. More information can be found here.
