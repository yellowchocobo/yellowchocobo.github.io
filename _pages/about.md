Hi, my name is Nils. I am currently a researcher at Stanford University and the University of Oslo via a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global fellowship funded by the European Union (end of project October 2024). I use satellite pictures, geographical information system (GIS) software, and computer sciences to understand surface processes on planetary surfaces. My research focuses mainly on better understanding the impact crater formation mechanisms and how this affects our understanding of the evolution of planetary bodies. You can find more information about this project (BOULDERING) in the "Research" section of this website. 

# Background

I earned my Ph.D. in Planetary Sciences in 2018 at the Centre for Earth Evolution and Dynamics (CEED) at the University of Oslo, under the supervision Prof. Stephanie Werner and Dr. Tobias Rolf in the Earth and Beyond lab, and Prof. Kaï Wünnemann at the Natural History Museum of Berlin. My Ph.D focused on numerical impact crater modeling and the investigation of the effect of different target properties on the diameter of craters. I subsequently did a postdoctoral researcher position in the same lab, where I continued to work on the same project but shifted my focus towards the observations of impact craters with the help of remote sensing. Earlier in my career I  worked outside of academia as a civil engineer and hydrologist in different Norwegian companies based in Oslo (Norway). Over the last few years, I have changed a little bit focus, and I am now working more as a computer scientist,  specifically in the use of deep learning to extract patterns of interest from satellite imagery.

Research interest
======
Here are few of my research interests. 

Machine and deep learning applied to remote sensing
------
Since 2019/2020 I have been working in AI solutions applied to remote sensing. This is something I am very interested with which combines the multidisciplinary skills I have gathered over the years (remote sensing, programming, GIS, hydrology, physical geography, geohazards). Among others, I am currently training a deep learning algorithm to automatically detect boulders (rock fragments) on planetary surfaces (see Projects). During my time as software engineer at Science & Technology AS Norway, I have been involved in the automatic detection of the pine wilt disease from Sentinel-2 spacecraft imagery (a tree disease currently spreading all over Europe and North America) and the training of semantic segmentation algorithm to automatically detect land use changes in Norway and other European countries.  

Impact cratering
------

A large part of my researcher career has focus on the study of the formation of impact craters. I have investigated the formation of impact craters with the help of impact numerical models. Among others, I investigated the influence of target properties on crater dimensions, and derived scaling laws so that a relationship between the projectile properties

Land surface processes on planetary surfaces

However, in general, I am interested in the study of all land surface processes. During my education,
